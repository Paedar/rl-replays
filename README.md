Utilities for processing rocket league replays. I wanted to make my own, even though [others](https://github.com/rocket-league-replays/rocket-league-replays/wiki/Rocket-League-Replay-Parsers) exist. One main reason is I want to do some work on analysis that I may or may not disclose. Step one would be to parse the replay files and since other packages for that already exist, I figured this part should be open source.

For a discussion about the replay format, there's a [topic](https://www.psyonix.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=13656) available at the Psyonix forums.
